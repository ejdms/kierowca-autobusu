The Kierowca Autobusu game consists of several stages:

1. Adding players
2. Each player has 2 cards, he must decide whether the first card is red or higher and whether the second card is higher, lower or the same compared to the first card. For every mistake he has to drink a sip.
3. This is the main phase of the game, where cards that have not been dealt to players form a "Christmas tree" in which the cards on each floor have different properties:

- floors 1, 3 and 5 - the player who has the same symbol on the card drinks the number of sips equal to the floor number
- floors 2 and 4 - the player who has the same symbol on the card distributes the number of sips equal to the floor number to other players
- floor 6 - Kierowca autobusu - the player who has the same symbol on the card drinks 6 sips and distributes 6 sips to other players. This player participates in the last phase of the game

4. Kierowca autobusu - a phase in which from the deck of all cards involved in the game the player who was unlucky to have the same card as in the sixth floor of the "Christmas tree" from the third phase must guess 5 cards in a row. It consists in "red or black" in the context of the first card, and then "higher, lower or the same" in relation to the first card. If he makes a mistake, he takes a sip of the drink and starts from the beginning. Play like this to win (guessing 5 cards in a row) or to the end of the deck of cards (un-guessed cards are not added to the deck)

Additional information:

- if the player has the same 2 cards and they are the same as the symbol on the "Christmas tree", they stack (so instead of drinking 5 sips of drink, he must drink 10, instead of giving 4 sips of drink, he gives 8 or can even play two rounds of phase 4)
